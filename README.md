# Exploring-marcap-of-cryptocurrencies
Here I have done an analysis of Market Capitalization of Cryptocurrencies.
Clone or Download the above ipynb file to get to know about this project.

In this project I have interpretted the precentage of shares, values of each cryptocurrency(in USD), REPRESENTED THE TOP GAINERS AND LOOSERS (both per day and per week values), and finally have concluded with the top most share holding cryptocurrency corporations.

I have used API from coinmarketcap website so please make sure that you have Internet access.
link of API: "https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/"

The required files are present in "Dataset" folder above.

REQUIREMENTS:
Anaconda Navigator (jupyter notebook).
python installed workspace.
Internet connection (for API usage).

Note:
  This code is written in such a way that it can take realtime values from API and process it to produce the required results, so the result will be up-to-current market values (up-to-date).
